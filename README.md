# IntelliJ platform guidelines
This is a repository for IntelliJ platform user interface guidelines: [https://jetbrains.design/intellij/](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/) 

## Working with the site locally
To check out and run a local copy of the site follow the steps described below.

### Pre-requirements
1. This site requires [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Follow the instruction to install
 Jekyll on your machine:
 * [Mac OS](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/install-jekyll-on-os-x/)
 * [Windows](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/install-jekyll-on-windows/)
 * [Linux](http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/install-jekyll-on-linux/)
2. Install bundler:

    ```
    gem install bundler
    ```
3. Install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac)



### Checking out site repository
To check out the source code run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/ui.git
```
and install the dependencies with Bundler inside the project directory:  

```
cd ui/
bundle install
```  

### Building and previewing
To start the web-server go to the project directory and run:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Jekyll will build the site and start a web server, which can be viewed in your browser at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

### Editing
To edit the guidelines open it in IDE. Guidelines pages are stored in _docs folder and are organised by categories. Pages are in Markdown format. See quick primer on writing in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

* To edit a page open the required .md file and modify it. Enable preview mode for markdown files on the right top corner:  
 ![test](/images/readme/mardown_preview.png)
* To create a new page, create new .md file in the corresponding category directory. The file should start with: 
    
```

---
title: Combobox 
category: Components  
---
``` 

The site is updated on the fly, refresh the page in browser to see changes. When you finish editing, publish your changes to the repository using **VCS | Commit Changes...**, which allows you to either commit or commit and push.
