## Title

Use for:
* Actions — buttons, menus, and links that invoke an action
* Headers in tables, dialogs, message boxes, notifications and tooltips
* Labels of UI elements groups 

<aside class="note sideblock _visible">The current Windows guidelines use sentence capitalization for actions. Some Microsoft products still title-capitalize actions according to the previous guidelines. Mac OS X also title-capitalizes actions. Since IntelliJ IDEs are cross-platform, we use title capitalization as well.</aside>


### Rules

Always capitalize the first and the last words.

Capitalize the words in-between except:
* articles: _a, an, the_,
* coordinating conjunctions: *and, or, but*,
* prepositions of four and less letters which are not a part of a phrasal verb: *in, with*.

In hyphenated phrases, capitalize all nouns, adjectives and adverbs: *Auto-Indent, Command-Line Launcher*.
Do not capitalize articles, prepositions and conjunctions: *Side-by-Side, Drag-and-Drop*.


### Examples
<p class="noanchor">
<i>Compare With…</i> — the short preposition with is capitalized because it is the last word. <br/>

<i>Compare with Latest Repository Version</i> — with is not capitalized when in the middle. <br/>

<i>Check Out from Version Control</i> — <i>out</i> is a part of the phrasal verb <i>check out</i> and is capitalized.
</p>


## Sentence

Use for:
* Labels for UI controls: text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, comboboxes, etc.
* Items in comboboxes, lists, trees and tables
* Body text in error messages, tooltips, notifications, status descriptions and any kind of instructions (but title-capitalize their headers)

### Rules
Capitalize the first word in a sentence, proper nouns and adjectives, and abbreviations.

### Examples
<p class="noanchor">
<i>Control+Shift+F</i> — keyboard button names are considered proper nouns. <br/>

<i>Accept the terms of the License Agreement</i> — License Agreement is a proper noun. <br/>

<i>Side-by-side layout</i> — only the first word of a hyphenated phase is capitalized.
