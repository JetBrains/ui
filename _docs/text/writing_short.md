title: Writing short and clear
category: Text
---
<p class="noanchor">
Texts in user interfaces should be short and clear. Short texts save reading time. Clear texts lead to fewer mistakes. Editing methods described below can help with that.
</p>


## Use simple constructions 

Use simple verb forms. Prefer present tense.

Use simple sentences: one idea per sentence.

Avoid passive voice.

<p class="noanchor">
This way the same meaning can be expressed with less words. Compare: <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Those resources that are available locally</i> <span style="font-size:large;">→</span> <i>Local resources</i> <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Maven has to use</i> <span style="font-size:large;">→</span> <i>Maven uses</i> <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The use of a secure connection is required</i> <span style="font-size:large;">→</span> <i>Use secure connection</i>
</p>


## Remove or elaborate generic words 

Words like general, advanced, and options do not add useful information and can be removed with no harm to the meaning: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-general.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-options.png)
*No meaning is lost after removing group headers "General" and "Options".*

Some generic words cannot be removed. They can appear in actionable elements like buttons, checkboxes or links. Or removing a group header could break a dialog layout. In such cases, use a more informative label instead:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/generic-renamed-link.png)
*The link "Learn more" does not explain what useful information could be there for the user to click it.*


## Remove obvious objects and actions 
Remove verbs that explain the function of a UI control:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-specify.png)
*Text boxes are made for input — an explicit instruction "specify" duplicates the meaning expressed by the text field. Additional information can be given under the field — see [Context help]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/context_help).* 

<table><col width="59%">
  <tr>
     <td> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-prefer.png"><em> A selected radio button means its option is "preferred". </em> </td>    
      <td> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-allow.png"><em> A checked checkbox means its feature <br>is "allowed". </em> </td>         
  </tr>
</table>

Remove words with a meaning that is already expressed in the label:
<table>
  <col width="59%">
    <tr>
       <td> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-contents.png">
            <em> The clipboard’s purpose is to keep information so the infinitive "to keep" is implying the obvious and can be removed.</em> </td>    
       <td> <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/obvious-functionality.png">
            <em> The word “functionality” is already implied by "Drag’n’Drop" and can be removed. </em> </td>         
    </tr>
</table>


## Do not address the user
A user interface is for a person who uses it. Addressing this person is unnecessary because they by default perceive the text they see as for them:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/addressing1.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/addressing2.png)
*The whole phrase after the comma is not needed because its meaning is already expressed by the verb "configure".*


## Remove duplicates
If the repeating word appears in element labels, move it to the beginning. Finding a setting becomes faster as you scan only meaningful words:

Remove duplicates in meaning:

## Translate from tech to human
When you make a feature, you know how it works from the inside and can describe it from the implementation point of view: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/indent-options-before.png)
A person not familiar with implementation details won’t know what the Automatic indent options detector is, why file’s indent options have been overwritten and what indent size=2 means. Translated to the “human” language, the message reads: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/indent-options-after.png) 
Always write UI text from a user’s perspective. Avoid technical terms, jargon and descriptions of inner logic that a user might not know.

 
## Write for first-time users
After writing a UI text, imagine seeing it for the first time and try to understand what might be unclear or confusing. Then correct if necessary.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-file-colors-before.png)
*For a first-time user, Enable File Colors enables or disables the other two options (but it does not).*
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-file-colors-after.png)
*Rewritten: now all options are equal.*
More examples:
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-auto-insert.png) 
*Before: The title can be read as “Auto-insert when only one checkbox is on” making you ask how does it work when both checkboxes are on. After: Replacing choice with completion option makes the title unambiguous.*
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/writing_short/first-time-smart-keys.png)
*Before: What do smart Home and End keys do? What do they do if they are not smart? After: Added text explains what the options do so that the reader can make an informed choice.*
