## When to use

Follow the rules for [progress indicators]({{site.baseurl}}/controls/progress_indicators).


## How to use

### Types

Use **determinate** progress bar, if the process duration is known:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/determinate_example.png)

Otherwise use **indeterminate** progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/indeterminate_example.png)

If an indeterminate process reaches a point where its duration can be determined, switch to a determinate progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/progress_bar_indeterminate.png)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/progress_bar_determinate.png)


### Process name and details

A progress bar can have process name and process details. For wording follow the rules for [progress text]({{site
.baseurl}}/controls/progress_text).

#### Process name

Place process name above the progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/label_above.png)

If the vertical space is limited, place the process name with a colon on the left:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/label_left.png)

If there are several processes in a group, add a bold header. The header is a noun.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/several_progresses.png)

Do **not** show process name for inline processes:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/tool_window.png)


#### Process details

Place process details under the progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/comment.png)

Use one line and limit by the length of the progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/comment_long.png)

If space is limited show percentage completed:

#### In dialog

Use process name as dialog header, title capitalize it and remove ellipsis. Process details appear above the progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/dialog.png)

#### In status bar

Place process name under the progress bar in the Status bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/status_bar.png)




### Process status

If the process consists of the substeps that can fail and do not terminate the process, then use green and red colors to show the intermediate status. For example, show the status of the running tests:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/progress_color.png)

Do **not** color progress bar to show the final result of a task, use [notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/notifications/). If the process finishes hide the progress bar. In case of success show notification for the user-initiated tasks, in case of failure — for all tasks.


### Process control

Provide the Cancel button in the progress dialog, if the process can be interrupted (see [Loading Project dialog]({{site.baseurl}}/controls/progress_bar/#in-dialog))
. Use the Stop button if interrupting does not return the environment to its previous state.

Use the Stop icon, if there are several processes at the same time in one dialog or there is not enough space for the
 button (e.g. [Status bar]({{site.baseurl}}/controls/progress_bar/#in-status-bar)):

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/tasks_dialog.png)

Always place the Stop icon on the right next to the progress bar. On hover over the Stop icon make it darker and show “Stop” or “Cancel” comment under the progress bar:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/hover_stop_icon.png)

If the process takes a long time and can prevent user from performing the tasks, then provide an option to pause a process using a Pause button or Pause icon:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/pause.png)

It is **not** recommended to provide an option to pause the process. It is preferable, that the process runs in the background and does not interfere with the user.

If the user has paused the process, then change the Pause button label to Resume or Pause icon to Resume icon, add “Paused” comment:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/progress_bar/resume.png)

Hide the progress bar as soon as process completes.


## Sizes and placement

The progress form and sizes are the same in all themes.
