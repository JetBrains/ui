Group controls to organize content on a screen and help people locate the necessary controls faster.

Use the following controls or layouts:
* [Group headers]({{site.baseurl}}/controls/group_header)
* [Tabs]({{site.baseurl}}/controls/tabs)
* [Master-detail layout]({{site.baseurl}}/principles/masterdetail_layout)


## What grouping to choose

Use **group headers** if all rules apply:

<aside class="note sideblock _visible">If there are less than 3 controls in all groups, consider separating with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/controls/group_header/#03">vertical insets</a>.</aside>

* Each group contains **no** more than 10 controls

* All groups occupy no more than 2 heights of the dialog in its default size

Use **tabs** if all rules apply:
* One of the groups contains more than 10 controls or groups occupy more than 2 heights of a dialog
* There are **no** more than 8 groups

Use the **master-detail layout** if either of the rules applies:
* There are more than 8 groups
* The number of groups can change
